## Credits

I borrowed the questions and layout from the gif that was provided as a reference. It can be found in the assets folder and looks like [this](/assets/04-web-apis-homework-demo.gif). I also received some guidance from a BCS tutor, David Elutilo, who helped me understand how to apply the dynamic HTML 

I used [this link](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-create-css-rule-for-all-elements-except-one-class/#) to figure out how to target all elements except for one for button styling.
